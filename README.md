# SchoolSystemNetCore
This is a study project to apply all my knowledge and experiences in Web Developement
## Idea
School system is for monitoring the communication between students, teachers and parents. The main objective for teachers is to be able to communicate with their students and their parents easily and to send notifications or upload tasks and send them their grades. For students it’s about making groups for each course with their colleges and their teachers and easing the process of submitting homework. For parents it’s more about monitoring their children grades in every course and making the communication with the teachers easier.
